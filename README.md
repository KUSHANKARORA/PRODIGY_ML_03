**Cat and Dog Image Classifier**
Welcome to the Cat and Dog Image Classifier project! This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. This project was completed as part of a machine learning internship at Prodigy Infotech.

**Project Overview**

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images of cats and dogs. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) due to its excellent performance in image recognition tasks. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images and tested for accuracy and generalization. This project was undertaken as a machine learning intern at Prodigy Infotech, where I gained hands-on experience in building and deploying deep learning models.
